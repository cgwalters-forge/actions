# actions

GitHub Actions for cgwalters-forge and bootc-dev workflows, one per
directory, used as `cgwalters-forge/actions/<name>@v1`. Work items are
this repository's issues.

| Action | Status | Roadmap |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [tailscale](tailscale/README.md) | Settings by organization; CI runs its unit tests and checks the socket and CLI are closed after a join that fails, no real join (no tailnet credentials here) | Replace devspace.yml's and agent.yml's tailscale/github-action steps; take over the RHEL prerequisites |

## cgwalters-agentic-job

One reusable workflow is here too:
[cgwalters-agentic-job](.github/workflows/cgwalters-agentic-job.yml), an
agent run of cgwalters-forge/agentic-job with this deployment's tailnet
join, inference proxy, runner, agent and model. Our repositories call it
at a pinned commit, which is the one `job_workflow_ref` the inference
broker and the tailnet have to admit.

A repository gets agent runs with the workflow below, a bounds file at
`.github/agentic-job/dispatch.toml` (and `fix.toml` for the `fix` kind), a
runner configuration at `.github/agentic-job/hosted.toml`, and an
environment that gates the apply token; cgwalters-forge/tracker has all four
to copy. `COMMIT` is a full commit of this repository. The file's header
says what else a caller may set.
