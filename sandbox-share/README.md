# sandbox-share

Publishes a file, a directory tree or literal content as a root-owned,
world-readable copy under `/etc/agent-share/<name>`, so that the
sandboxed steps of a
[workflow-compiler](https://github.com/cgwalters-forge/workflow-compiler)
job can read it but not change it. It is what the compiler emits for a
`share` runner step, pinned by commit; it runs as root through `sudo`,
before the job enters its sandbox.

```yaml
- uses: cgwalters-forge/actions/sandbox-share@<sha>
  with:
    name: config
    path: ci/config.toml
```

Inputs:

- `name`: the name under `/etc/agent-share`, matching
  `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`.
- `path`: a file or directory to copy, relative to the workspace.
- `content`: literal file content, used when `path` is empty.

The copy is built next to its final name and renamed into place, owned by
root with 0644 files and 0755 directories. A symlink or special file in
the source, or a `path` that goes through a symlink, is refused: a
checkout can hold a symlink to `/etc/shadow`, and following it as root
would publish the target to every user.
